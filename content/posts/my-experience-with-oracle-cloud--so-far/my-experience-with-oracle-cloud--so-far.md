I have my fair share of experience with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). One provider I never tried is **Oracle Cloud**. It is a cloud provider that is not talked about often due to some issues that came up over the past few months. "Out of capacity" is an error that I see due to the lack of resources in one region's availability domain. I could never deploy an Ampere A1 always-free instance because at the time of writing this, it is so popular that there are no resources at the moment.

However, there are scripts to keep retrying and snag an Ampere A1 instance. I gave up on using these because they can take a long ass time. Not to mention, you would need to rely on another instance to have the script keep running. Instead, I launched an Intel based instance because of the free trial credits I have at the moment.
